# Migration Ledger — legacy corpus → this repository

Policy: `governance/migration-plan.md`. One row per legacy file touched.
Dispositions: MIGRATED-VERBATIM / REWRITTEN / SUPERSEDED / DROPPED /
COLD-ARCHIVE. A claim is migration-clean when its `legacy_evidence` has no
unresolved `legacy:` pointer.

**Target layout** (since 2026-06-05 reorganisation): migrated files live under
`archive/legacy/` in the per-tag layout — `notes/<TheoryTag>/` (all versions
together), `scripts/` (flat, runnable as-is), `artefacts/<TheoryTag>/`. The
"Legacy path" column below records the ORIGINAL path in the legacy repository;
the target is determined by file kind + tag. Lookup table:
`archive/legacy/INDEX.md`.

## Migration batch 1 — Sector-B evidence chain (plan phase M1, 2026-06-05)

Re-validation: all four §6.3.8 verification scripts re-run in a fresh sandbox
environment (python 3.12, numpy 2.2.6) — **277/277 self-test asserts PASS**;
regenerated JSONs match archived artefacts within rel_tol $10^{-9}$
(`claims/A1-KERNEL-CONV/runs/260605-migration-revalidation/`, `claims/B2-PROPA-HLAYER/runs/260605-migration-revalidation/`).
One finding: **STALE-ARTEFACT** — the archived Math437 `step5_class_closure.json`
predates the R1 repair (v1.0-era verdict string; numerics identical); the fresh
artefact under `runs/` is canonical for TSv2 citation. Convention check: all
items are themselves the corrected-convention ($r_{\rm braz}=K(q_0)=\mu^2$)
lineage — no stale-convention content. Sign-off: **SIGNED 2026-06-05** (operator review verdict:
"B2-PROPA-HLAYER migration v1.3 = PASS"; chain migration-clean,
reproducible, 277/277).
Batch record note: `claims/B2-PROPA-HLAYER/notes/proposition-a-migration-revalidation-260605-260605-v1.4.tex.txt` (+ PDF beside it; v1.0 .md / v1.1 / v1.2 superseded re-issues, all kept).

All dispositions in this batch are MIGRATED-VERBATIM.

## Migration batch 2 — enumerated-reading / estimator chain (plan phase M1, 2026-06-05)

Goal: make `B1-RH-ENUM` migration-clean and ground the H-LAYER justification
chain. Re-validation: all eight verification scripts re-run fresh (python
3.12, numpy 2.2.6) — **167/167 self-test asserts PASS** (5+21+19+11+15+25+22+49);
all regenerated JSONs identical to the archived artefacts within rel_tol
$10^{-9}$ — **zero diffs, zero stale-artefact findings** (contrast batch 1's
F-1). Math434/Math436 are checkpoint-resumable by design and completed within
one budget window on this hardware; their archived `state.json` files are kept
as provenance. Fresh artefacts:
`claims/B1-RH-ENUM/runs/260605-migration-revalidation/` (8 JSONs + summary).
Sign-off: rows feed B1 (T5) directly and support hypothesis H-LAYER of the
T6 claim — **operator sign-off: SIGNED 2026-06-05** (review verdict:
"B1-RH-ENUM migration = PASS; evidence chain migration-clean and
reproducible").
Batch record note: `claims/B1-RH-ENUM/notes/enumerated-readings-migration-revalidation-260605-260605-v1.1.tex.txt`.

All dispositions in this batch are MIGRATED-VERBATIM.

## Translation events (not file migrations)

| Event | Source | Result | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ledger seeding | legacy `Docs/status/TOE-FACT-SHEET.md` (snapshot 2026-06-05, Math442 state) | 17 claim cards under `claims/`, translated per `governance/tier-system.md` §4 | 2026-06-05 |
| Hypothesis transcription | Math437 v1.2 §Hypotheses | H-LAYER, H-A0 verbatim entries in `claims/GATES.md` | 2026-06-05 |
| Archive reorganisation | flat original-path mirror | per-tag layout (`notes/<Tag>/`, `scripts/`, `artefacts/<Tag>/`) + `INDEX.md`; all card paths updated; scripts re-verified runnable post-move (10/10) | 2026-06-05 |

## Migration queue (plan phase M1; updated 2026-06-05)

1. ~~Sector-B chain (Math426/435/437/440/441/442 + scripts + JSONs)~~ — **DONE
   (batch 1)**. A1, B2 migration-clean; B1 partially resolved.
2. ~~Math427–432 / Math434(+AddA) / Math436 enumerated-reading + estimator
   chain~~ — **DONE (batch 2)**. B1 migration-clean; H-LAYER justification
   chain grounded; Packet-A evidence complete.
3. T7-candidates: `C2-LORENTZ-EMERGENT`, `C3-EP`, `D3-CHIRALITY`.

## Migration batch 3 — Sector-B mass-gap (B4-MASS-GAP) (plan phase M1, 2026-06-23)

Goal: complete the Sector-B critical-path migration (`governance/migration-plan.md`
§4 priority 1) by making `B4-MASS-GAP` migration-clean. Demand-driven: exactly
the evidence the B4 card cites — Math01-v2 (uniqueness within cone), the Math56
constraint-cone cluster, and Math82 Addenda G/G2/G3 (continuation curve + audits)
— plus the continuation-run provenance manifest.

**Re-validation (honest grade).** Two axes achieved, one waived:
(a) **verbatim text** — all 7 migrated notes are byte-identical to the frozen
legacy originals (SHA-256 verified at migration time: Math01-v2 `6aeffab9`;
Math56 `a5546466`/`26255775`/`4c99f5f9`; Math82 G/G2/G3
`9c76de35`/`2025a665`/`fd038f4a`);
(b) **provenance cross-check** — the migrated manifest's continuation point #1
($\mu^2=5.0\times10^{-3}$, converged, $m^{*2}=+4.247\times10^{-2}$,
$\Delta F=+4.150\times10^{-10}$) reproduces the B4 card anchor to every quoted
digit;
(c) **numerical re-execution — WAIVED (reasoned)** — the anchor is a production
Newton–Krylov continuation fixed point (`continuation_mu2_v25.py` v2.6.4, $N=32$,
$L_{\rm bcc}=7$, BCC analytic `.npy` seed), not sandbox-reproducible. Re-execution
is deferred to an operator-side reproduction bundle; B4's reproduction status
stays **PACKAGE-PENDING** (migration does not discharge it). This is the
§6 "re-run artefact OR reasoned waiver" disposition.

**Convention check.** Pillar-1 mass-gap content in the corrected production-kernel
convention $r_{\rm braz}=K(q_0)=\mu^2$; the Math82 continuation is parameterised
in $\mu^2$ ($r=\mu^2+0.2140336$, verified at points #1 and #4) — no
stale-convention content. Math01-v2 / Math56 are structural / variational and
convention-neutral.

**Scope preservation.** No tier action. CLOSED@SINGLE-MODE-CONE (T5) preserved;
the anchor is the metastable subset-4-cosine branch (not the ground state);
Regime-III ($\mu^2\le-0.5$) remains undetermined per the migrated G2 audit.

Migration record + three-objection self-test:
`claims/B4-MASS-GAP/notes/b4-massgap-migration-260623-260623-v1.0.tex.txt` (+ PDF).

All dispositions in this batch are MIGRATED-VERBATIM. The Math82 second-order
audit (`TECT-Math82-Addendum-G4-second-order-audit.tex.txt`) is **not** cited by
the B4 card and is left for demand-driven migration. The production continuation
driver (`continuation_mu2_v25.py`) is COLD-ARCHIVE (production machinery,
migration-plan §5); only its run manifest migrates as provenance.

## Migration batch 4 — B3-BCC-STRUCT reframe to corrected continuum basis (plan phase M1, 2026-06-23)

Goal: make `B3-BCC-STRUCT` migration-clean. Demand-driven re-validation of the
card's seeded `legacy:Packet-B lineage (N_loop, L_4, ΔF tables)` pointer found
the cited evidence **refuted**, so the disposition is **SUPERSEDED**, not
MIGRATED-VERBATIM-as-support, and B3 is reframed onto the surviving
continuum-anchored B1 evidence (already migrated, batch 2).

**Re-validation finding (the migration gate working as intended).** The seeded
B3 evidence is the single-shell SMA structural ranking (Math194) + the 1-mode
K_4/K_6 ranking (Math383). Running the migrated `Math194_brazovskii_lattice_ranking.py`
in a fresh sandbox reproduces **BCC at rank 9 of 10** (lamellar rank 1,
$F/V=-1.21\times10^{-5}$; bcc $F/V=-4.84\times10^{-6}$); the script even prints
`[WARNING] BCC is Rank 9, not Rank 1!` while its own verdict logic erroneously
declares "uniqueness CONFIRMED". This is the **opposite** of the B3 statement
$F_{\rm BCC}<F_{\rm FCC}<F_{\rm SC}$. Independently, **Math400 (2026-05-11,
T0 REFUTATION, binding)** refutes Math383's main claim and its §2 K-table
(lamellar $K_4=1.5$ not $3$; BCC $K_4=3.75$ not $1.0$), and shows that in the
symmetry-preserving multi-shell SMA lamellar is the deepest configuration and
the canonical-$\mu^2$ "BCC minimum" is a saddle. The fixed-ordered-BCC-vacuum
reading is already retired in `negative-results/registry.md`
(`NG-2026-legacy-ordered-vacuum`).

**Disposition: SUPERSEDED** (migration-plan §2; archive copies kept verbatim
for history, cross-linked to the refutation). B3 is reframed onto the surviving
**B1-RH-ENUM (T7)** continuum-anchored enumerated-reading evidence
(Math431 LAM/HEX/FCC races, Math434/436 exact-Wick brackets, Math428 Bloch
log-det, Math432 two-shell ensemble — all migration-clean, batch 2). No tier
change (B3 stays T4); reframe record + devil's-advocate:
`claims/B3-BCC-STRUCT/notes/b3-reframe-continuum-260623-260623-v1.0.tex.txt`.
