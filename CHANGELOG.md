## [Code-Versioning] Uniform date+version management extended to code and results — 2026-06-05

- **Operator directive**: everything — documents, code, scripts, results —
  carries date+version management. **Mechanism differs by artefact class**
  (`governance/naming-and-versioning.md` §5, binding):
  documents = filename two-date re-issue (citable immutable artefacts);
  **code = in-place evolution under git + mandatory version header**
  (`__version__`, `__first_issued__`, `__version_issued__`, optional
  `__claims__`, docstring changelog) — filename re-issue of code is FORBIDDEN
  (breaks imports/reproduction; side-by-side copies = the stale-physics drift
  class behind the legacy corrected-convention cascade);
  **results = immutable run folders** (new run = new
  `runs/<claim>/<YYMMDD>-<descriptive-tag>/`), artefacts record producing-code
  versions (+ git commit when available) — `verification-standard.md` §4.
- **Catalog upgraded** (`build_catalog.py` v1.1.0): parses python version
  headers and run-artefact dates, so code and results now show the same
  first-issue / version-issue / version columns as documents in `CATALOG.md`
  — uniform visibility without uniform mechanism. Harness scripts carry their
  headers (lint_claims v1.2.0, build_catalog v1.1.0).
- Archive scripts stay verbatim-immutable (no headers; dates in the ledger).
- No tier changes; linter PASS; catalog + ledger views in sync.

## [Catalog] Derived artefact catalog — database capability without a database — 2026-06-05

- **Binding rule** (`governance/verification-standard.md` §8): the repository
  gets database-grade indexing as a DERIVED, disposable index only — the files,
  `claims/*/status.json`, and git history remain the sole sources of truth;
  authoritative stores beside them are forbidden (same single-source principle
  as `CLAIMS.md`/`BY-CLAIM.md`; kills the legacy mirror-drift class).
- **New generator** `verification/scripts/build_catalog.py` → `CATALOG.md`
  (human view, by artefact kind) + `verification/catalog.json` (machine twin):
  path, kind, claim links, theory tag, two-date fields, version, lifecycle
  (SUPERSEDED auto-detected from banners — currently 3), size, sha256/12.
  105 artefacts at first issue. CI `--check` step + smoke test added;
  `CATALOG.md` joins the root canonical set.
- No tier changes; linter PASS; all generated files in sync.

## [Naming] Human-readable filenames + first-issue-date convention — 2026-06-05

- **Binding naming rules added** (operator directive;
  `governance/naming-and-versioning.md` §3): (i) file/folder names and document
  headings lead with DESCRIPTIVE English slugs — internal codes (claim IDs,
  gate IDs, migration-phase labels) are never the sole identifying token
  outside the registry layer, and every code is expanded at first use in
  document bodies; (ii) two-date rule (refined same
  day by operator): first issue carries `-<YYMMDD-first>-v1.0`; every later
  version carries BOTH the first-issue date and its own issue date —
  `<slug>-<YYMMDD-first>-<YYMMDD-current>-vN.M.md` — so the filename shows the
  document's birth date and the currency of the version at a glance.
- **Renames applied**: batch-1 record note →
  `claims/B2-PROPA-HLAYER/notes/proposition-a-migration-revalidation-260605-v1.0.md`;
  run folders → `runs/<claim>/260605-migration-revalidation/`; all references
  swept (ledger, index, cards, note body); older CHANGELOG entries left
  untouched as historical record.
- Future claim IDs use fully descriptive slugs (`claim-standard.md` §2);
  seeded IDs grandfathered. Run-folder tags must be descriptive words
  (`naming-and-versioning.md` §6). Synthesis-document pattern now
  `<descriptive-slug>-synthesis-<YYMMDD>-vN.M.md`.
- No tier changes; linter PASS; generated files in sync.

## [Layers] Three-layer architecture: claim packages, synthesis theory/, BY-CLAIM view — 2026-06-05

- **Layer model formalised** (operator design): L1 proof system (`claims/` +
  `archive/` + `codes/` + `runs/` + `verification/` + ledgers) → L2 theory
  synthesis (`theory/`, consolidated sector expositions citing only claim IDs
  at registered tiers) → L3 publication (`publish/`). Documented in
  `theory/README.md`; sector READMEs updated.
- **Working proof notes now live with their claim**:
  `claims/<ID>/notes/<claimID>-<slug>-vN.M.md` (claim folder = complete
  verification package: card + state + notes). The batch-1 record moved to
  `claims/B2-PROPA-HLAYER/notes/B2-PROPA-HLAYER-m1-revalidation-v1.0.md`;
  all references updated. Policies: `naming-and-versioning.md` §3/§8,
  `claim-standard.md` §1, `migration-plan.md` §2.
- **Per-claim archive view is GENERATED, not physical**: archive stays in the
  per-tag layout (one legacy file can serve several claims; scripts must stay
  co-located to remain runnable; archive keyed by immutable theory tags, not
  mutable claim structure). New generated reverse-lookup
  `archive/legacy/BY-CLAIM.md` (claim → migrated files + reproduction command
  + unresolved `legacy:` debt), emitted and sync-checked by
  `lint_claims.py --render [--check]`.
- Housekeeping: orphan `pytest-cache-files-*/` + `.pytest_cache/` (from the
  sandbox pytest cacheprovider crash) moved out of the tree and gitignored.
- No tier changes; linter PASS; generated files in sync.

## [M1/Reorg] Archive per-tag layout + first TSv2 theory note — 2026-06-05

- **Archive reorganised** (operator request): `archive/legacy/` moved from the
  flat original-path mirror to the per-tag layout `notes/<TheoryTag>/` (all
  versions of a tag together, superseded banners intact), `scripts/` (flat,
  runnable as-is — sibling imports preserved; re-verified 10/10 post-move),
  `artefacts/<TheoryTag>/`. Original legacy paths remain recorded per file in
  `archive/MIGRATION-LEDGER.md`; new lookup table `archive/legacy/INDEX.md`;
  layout documented in `archive/README.md` and reflected in
  `governance/migration-plan.md` §1/§2 and `governance/naming-and-versioning.md` §8.
- **All evidence paths updated** [A1-KERNEL-CONV, B1-RH-ENUM, B2-PROPA-HLAYER]:
  status.json + claim.md + runs summaries + GATES.md source pointers now cite
  the per-tag paths; reproduction commands now `cd archive/legacy/scripts`.
- **First TSv2 theory note issued**:
  `theory/sector-B-vacuum/B2-PROPA-HLAYER-m1-revalidation-v1.0.md` — the
  permanent batch-1 record (re-validation table, STALE-ARTEFACT finding F-1,
  hypothesis transcription, devil's-advocate α/β/γ, §6 result footer),
  demonstrating the versioned-re-issue scheme (`-v<major>.<minor>.md`, full
  revision banner, all versions kept).
- No tier changes; linter PASS.

## [M1/Migration] Sector-B evidence chain migrated + re-validated (277/277 asserts) — 2026-06-05

- **Batch 1 of pull-based migration** (`governance/migration-plan.md` §4 priority 1):
  23 legacy files (11 notes: Math426+AddA/AddB, Math435 v1.0–v1.1, Math437
  v1.0–v1.2, Math440, Math441, Math442; 7 scripts incl. 3 import dependencies;
  5 run JSONs) copied MIGRATED-VERBATIM to `archive/legacy/` at original paths.
- **Re-validation**: all four verification scripts re-run in a fresh
  environment — 10/10 (Math426), 101/101 (Math435), 91/91 (Math437),
  75/75 (Math440) self-test asserts PASS; regenerated JSONs identical to
  archived artefacts within rel_tol 1e-9. Artefacts:
  `runs/A1-KERNEL-CONV/260605-m1-reval/`, `runs/B2-PROPA-HLAYER/260605-m1-reval/`.
- **Finding (STALE-ARTEFACT)**: archived Math437 `step5_class_closure.json`
  predates the R1 repair (v1.0-era verdict string; numerics identical). Fresh
  artefact under `runs/` is canonical for TSv2 citation.
- **Claim updates** [A1-KERNEL-CONV, B1-RH-ENUM, B2-PROPA-HLAYER]: A1 and B2
  are migration-clean with reproduction **AVAILABLE** (two-script commands +
  expected outputs on the cards); B1 partially resolved (Math431-HEX chain
  still `legacy:` — next M1 batch). No tier changes.
- **H-LAYER / H-A0 transcribed verbatim** into `claims/GATES.md` from Math437
  v1.2 §Hypotheses (the H-LAYER beyond-layer residual is exactly STEP-5B).
- Migration ledger: 23 rows added; B2-feeding rows flagged
  **operator sign-off PENDING** per migration-plan §6.

## [Bootstrap] Repository structure, governance v2.0, seeded claim ledger — 2026-06-05

- Created the P0/P1/P2 three-tier repository layout (`internal/` local-only,
  repository = public verification surface, `publish/{website,papers}` curated).
- Issued `GOVERNANCE.md` v2.0 integrating the "TOE Proof Governance v1.0" and
  "Verification-First" drafts: Master Theorem + sectors A–F + GAP gates +
  TSv2 tier scale + evidence grades + claim-registration rule + no-overclaim +
  competition-closure + negative-result duty.
- Issued detailed policies under `governance/`: publication tiers, tier system
  (with legacy→TSv2 translation table), claim standard, verification standard,
  naming/versioning, migration plan.
- Seeded 17 claim cards (sectors A–F) translated conservatively from the legacy
  `TOE-FACT-SHEET.md` snapshot of 2026-06-05 (last theory tag Math442):
  Reading-H T5 estimator-grade; Prop-A T6 certified on {H-layer, H-A0};
  legacy-PROVED pillars enter as T6 with T7-candidate flags pending
  verification packages (no auto-T7 rule).
- Seeded `claims/GATES.md` (Step-5b gateway, G3'-b(iii), GAP-1..4 and named
  sub-gates), `predictions/prediction-ledger.md` (all OPEN/SCAFFOLD),
  `negative-results/registry.md` (six seeded entries incl. the Math245
  rollback and the eight failed classical-ħ routes).
- Built `verification/scripts/lint_claims.py` (schema + DAG acyclicity +
  tier-monotonicity/hypothesis rule + `--render` generator for `CLAIMS.md`);
  CI workflow at `.github/workflows/verify.yml`.
- `CLAIMS.md` is generated; hand-editing forbidden.
