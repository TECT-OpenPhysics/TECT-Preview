# TECT catalog index

Compact generated reader surface. The complete current machine inventory is
`../verification/catalog/index.json`; source files and Git history remain authoritative.
`../CATALOG.md` is a frozen compatibility volume at commit `4db22f4e`
for historical verifiers and no longer grows.

**3837 artefacts** · **49 live claim cards** ·
130 superseded artefacts retained

## Use

- Current compact metadata: `../verification/catalog-summary.json`
- Complete current machine inventory: `../verification/catalog/index.json`
- Frozen machine compatibility volume: `../verification/catalog.json`
- Live claim registry: `../CLAIMS.md`
- Proof and failure navigation: `../theory/proof-evidence-map.md`

New code should consume `catalog-summary.json` when it only needs counts or
top-level claim paths. Current inventory clients load only the required
kind shard from the manifest.
